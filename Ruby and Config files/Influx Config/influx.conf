### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified.  The commented out lines are the the configuration
# field and the default value used.  Uncommentting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
# reporting-disabled = false

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

  # Automatically create a default retention policy when creating a database.
  # retention-autocreate = true

  # If log messages are printed for the meta service
  # logging-enabled = true

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores TSM files.
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.

  # Trace logging provides more verbose output around the tsm engine. Turning
  # this on can provide more useful output for debugging tsm engine issues.
  # trace-logging-enabled = false

  # Whether queries should be logged before execution. Very useful for troubleshooting, but will
  # log any sensitive data contained within a query.
  # query-log-enabled = true

  # Settings for the TSM engine

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.
  # cache-max-memory-size = 1048576000

  # CacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will
  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = 26214400

  # which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to
  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes
  # cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "10m"

  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "4h"

  # high cardinality issues at the database level.  This limit can be disabled by setting it to
  # 0.
  # max-series-per-database = 1000000

  # The maximum number of tag values per tag that are allowed before writes are dropped.  This limit

  # disabled by setting it to 0.
  # max-values-per-tag = 100000



###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
###
### NOTE: This interface is deprecated as of 1.1.0 and will be removed in a future release.

  # The SSL certificate used when HTTPS is enabled.
  # https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

 [http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
   enabled = true

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.

  # Determines whether the pprof endpoint is enabled.  This endpoint is used for
  # troubleshooting and monitoring.
   pprof-enabled = true

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
   https-enabled = false

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.

  # The JWT auth shared secret to validate requests using JSON web tokens.

  # The default chunk size for result sets that should be chunked.
   max-row-limit = 10000

  # The maximum number of HTTP connections that may be open at once.  New connections that
  # would exceed this limit are dropped.  Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.
  # max-connection-limit = 0

  # Enable http service over unix domain socket
  # unix-socket-enabled = false

  # The path of the unix domain socket.
  # bind-socket = "/var/run/influxdb.sock"

###
### [[udp]]
###
### Controls the listeners for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
###

 [[udp]]

   database = "sensu"
  # retention-policy = ""

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # Flush if this many points get buffered
   batch-size = 5000

  # Number of batches that may be pending in memory
   batch-pending = 10

  # Will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit
